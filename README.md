# Computer Vision Assignment ‚Äì MŒ•Œï046 (Winter 2024‚Äì2025)

## üìù Description

This repository contains the solution to the **Computer Vision assignment** for the Winter 2024‚Äì2025 semester. The project is structured into two main parts:

- **Exercise 1**: Traditional Machine Learning methods for image classification.
- **Exercise 2**: Deep Learning models implemented with PyTorch.

All code is written in Python and executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The MNIST dataset (in both 8x8 and 28x28 resolutions) is used as the benchmark for training and evaluating models.

## ‚úÖ Assignment Breakdown

### üß† Exercise 1: Machine Learning (15 points)
- **1.1** Initial Setup (Sklearn)
- **1.2** Load and visualize low-res MNIST (8x8)
- **1.3** Classification using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- **1.4** Compute Confusion Matrix
- **1.5** Manual implementation of k-NN classifier (no Sklearn)
- **1.6** PCA + k-NN (manual PCA via SVD)

### ü§ñ Exercise 2: Deep Learning (15 points + 5 bonus)
- **2.1** Load and visualize high-res MNIST (28x28)
- **2.2** Train a basic Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- **2.3** Visualize learned weights
- **2.4** Implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **2.5** Bonus: Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch
